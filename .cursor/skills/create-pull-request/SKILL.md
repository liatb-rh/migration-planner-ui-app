# Create Pull Request

Create a pull request for the current changes.

## Authentication Blockers

The agent cannot perform operations requiring user credentials:

- **GPG-signed commits**: Requires user's passphrase
- **Git push**: May require GitHub authentication
- **GitHub PR creation (upstream)**: MCP token may lack permissions

For these operations, provide ready-to-use commands for the user to copy-paste.

## Steps

1. Check git status to see staged and unstaged changes
2. Run the following subagents in parallel:
   1. Validator Agent: Runs `make validate-all` to ensure code quality checks pass
   2. Reviewer Agent: Performs a code review
3. Stage all relevant files with `git add`
4. Write a commit message following the format:
   - Title: `<ticket-id> | <type>: <description>`
     - `<ticket-id>`: matches pattern `ECOPROJECT-\d+`
     - `<type>`: one of: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style, test
   - If no JIRA ticket: `NO-JIRA | <type>: <description>`
   - Body: bullet-list summarizing the changes
5. **Provide commit command to user** (do not attempt to execute):

   ```bash
   git commit -s -m '<title>

   <body>'
   ```

6. Wait for user to confirm commit is done
7. **Provide push command to user**:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

8. Wait for user to confirm push is done
9. **Provide PR creation command to user**:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --repo kubev2v/migration-planner-ui-app \
     --title "<title>" \
     --body "<PR body with summary and test plan>"
   ```

10. Ask user to share the PR URL when created
11. **Update Jira issue with PR URL and transition to Code Review** (see below)

## Jira Integration

After the PR is created, update the Jira issue:

### 1. Update the Jira issue with the PR URL

The "Git Pull Request" custom field ID is: **`customfield_12310220`**

Use `jira_update_issue` tool:

```json
{
  "issue_key": "<TICKET-ID>",
  "fields": {
    "customfield_12310220": "<PR-URL>"
  }
}
```

### 2. Fallback: Add as Web Link

If the custom field update fails (field removed or changed), add the PR as a remote issue link:

```json
{
  "issue_key": "<TICKET-ID>",
  "url": "<PR-URL>",
  "title": "Pull Request #<PR-NUMBER>",
  "summary": "<PR-TITLE>",
  "relationship": "pull request",
  "icon_url": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"
}
```

### 3. Transition the issue to "Code Review"

The "Code Review" transition ID is: **`61`**

Use `jira_transition_issue` tool:

```json
{
  "issue_key": "<TICKET-ID>",
  "transition_id": "61",
  "comment": "PR created: <PR-URL>"
}
```

### 4. Fallback: Find transition ID dynamically

If the transition fails (ID changed or not available for current status), use `jira_get_transitions` to find the correct ID:

```json
{
  "issue_key": "<TICKET-ID>"
}
```

Then look for the transition named "Code Review" in the response and use that ID.

### Example Jira Update Flow

```
1. jira_update_issue(
     issue_key="ECOPROJECT-1234",
     fields={"customfield_12310220": "https://github.com/kubev2v/migration-planner-ui-app/pull/371"}
   )

   If this fails, fallback to:

   jira_create_remote_issue_link(
     issue_key="ECOPROJECT-1234",
     url="https://github.com/kubev2v/migration-planner-ui-app/pull/371",
     title="Pull Request #371",
     summary="ECOPROJECT-1234 | fix: Default report view to first cluster",
     relationship="pull request",
     icon_url="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"
   )

2. jira_transition_issue(
     issue_key="ECOPROJECT-1234",
     transition_id="61",
     comment="PR created: https://github.com/kubev2v/migration-planner-ui-app/pull/371"
   )

   If this fails, fallback to:

   jira_get_transitions(issue_key="ECOPROJECT-1234")
   → Find "Code Review" in response, then retry with correct ID
```
