# Workflow

- Always run `make validate-all` before committing
- After implementing a plan, always validate formatting, linting, type-checking, and tests
- Run `npm test` to ensure tests pass before pushing
- When facing lint errors, first attempt to fix them with `make lint-fix`
- Reference `src/components/` for canonical component patterns
- API client: `@migration-planner-ui/api-client` and `@migration-planner-ui/ioc`
- For standalone mode, use `webpack.standalone.js` config
